The program concerns a team that responds to weather event calls.

## Prerequisites 🔧

To run the project, you need to have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Java installed and configured on your machine.

The project was built using version 19.0.2 of the Java SE Development Kit from Oracle.

It's worth noting that this project was developed and tested on the Windows operating system.

If you don't have Java installed, please visit the Oracle website for installation:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html

If you don't have an IDE, you can choose one according to your preference, but I recommend one of these two:
- IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/download/?section=windows
- VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

### Operation⚙️

In the initial menu of the application, you can choose whether you want to register an event, a team, a piece of equipment, or an attendance.

Furthermore, we have the option to display the already registered data, to link a piece of equipment to a team, to allocate an attendance to an event, to consult an attendance, to change the status of an attendance, to load existing initial data instead of typing everything from scratch(tested for excel archive), to clear the text box, or to exit the program.

### Observations🔎

Each type of registration requests its specific base data types.

To register an attendance, we need to have already registered an event.

To link a piece of equipment to a team, we need to have already registered a piece of equipment and a team.

To allocate an attendance to an event, we need to have already registered an attendance and an event.

An attendance can only be in four states: Pending, Executing, Finished, and Canceled.
